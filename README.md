# DESCRIPTION

﻿Emily wants to put on a fashion show, but she can't do it all. Follow her journey through four new events, help her pick a model, and gather materials for her clothes, and then see the finished result when the festival kicks off on Spring 19. Hat Mouse will also lend a paw and sell his hats alongside Emily's clothes, and another new vendor will offer fashion-related furniture items for your home.

Made for the Stardew Valley Discord mod contest July 2023!

# CONFIG:

Mod Jam Mode: when set to true, removes the conditions on events and special order, so the events can be viewed immediately and the festival will happen in Y1.
