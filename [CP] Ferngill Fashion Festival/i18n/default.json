    "Festival.FashionShow.Henry.R1.FashionShowComplete": "I don't know if I've ever seen Mia THIS excited over something. You can really see how much this event means to her.$1#$b#Even I'm starting to get all jazzed up for the show! And I don't even understand what's going on at these things most of the time. Her energy is so infectious it almost makes me want to get on stage myself!$10#$b#...Not that I ever would. In fact, forget I said anything. This conversation never happened. Just go be excited for Mia.$4",

I'm having a hard time keeping up with Mia on my own. Between all of the browsing, shopping, and getting ready for her time on stage... I'm kinda wiped out.$6#$b#Oh! But don't get me wrong!$11#$b#It's all been a blast. And seeing Mia up on stage was... really special. I'm glad everyone got to see what a star she is first hand.$10#$b...

    "Charles.spring.01": "Yri bought a couple of dresses from Emily. At first I was worried because, you know... designer clothes sound expensive.#$b#But it was actually really affordable and it made Yri happy, too, so it's a win-win.$h",
